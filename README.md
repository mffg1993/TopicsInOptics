# Optics Notes & Notebooks

This repository is a growing collection of notes, visualizations, and interactive Jupyter notebooks covering a wide range of topics in **optics**. It's meant to serve as a **personal reference**, a **learning archive**, and a **resource for students or researchers** working in experimental or theoretical optics.
